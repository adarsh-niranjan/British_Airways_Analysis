### British Airways Analysis.twbx:
It is the Tableau packaged workbook file.

## Details:
**We will analyse public reviews about their journey with British Airways and how it correlates with other aspects like aircraft type, seating, cabin crew, food, etc. We will also monitor the average rating over time in different time frames and the trend that it follows. The data will then be mapped to each country where British Airways operates. Every element will be interactive and dynamic.**
